# Reddit Automation Bot

This project is a Reddit automation bot designed to perform tasks such as logging into Reddit, posting images with titles, and commenting on specific posts. The bot leverages Selenium with Undetected ChromeDriver for browser automation.

---

## Features

- **Login Automation**: Automatically logs into a Reddit account using credentials stored in a `.env` file.
- **Post Creation**: Uploads images with titles to a specified subreddit.
- **Comment Posting**: Posts random comments from a predefined list to a target post.
- **Environment Configuration**: Supports dynamic configuration through environment variables.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Version 3.7 or above.
2. **Google Chrome**: Ensure the latest version is installed.
3. **Required Python Packages**: 
   - `selenium`
   - `undetected-chromedriver`
   - `python-dotenv`

---

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and run the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kirtan-Rajesh/Reddit_Bot.git
cd Reddit_Bot
```

### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
Activate the virtual environment:
- On macOS/Linux:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
- On Windows:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
```plaintext
REDDIT_USERNAME=<your_reddit_username>
REDDIT_PASSWORD=<your_reddit_password>
IMAGE_FOLDER=<path_to_folder_with_images>
COMMENTS_FILE=<path_to_comments.txt>
TITLES_FILE=<path_to_image_titles.json>
TARGET_POST_URL=<url_of_the_target_post>
```

### Step 5: Prepare Supporting Files
- **Images**: Place all images to be posted in the folder specified in `IMAGE_FOLDER`.
- **Comments**: Create a `comments.txt` file containing comments, one per line.
- **Titles**: Create an `image_titles.json` file mapping image filenames to titles:
```json
{
  "image1.jpg": "Funny Meme Title",
  "image2.png": "Another Meme Title"
}
```

## Usage

### Run the Bot
Execute the following command to run the bot:
```bash
python reddit_bot.py
```

### Bot Workflow
1. Logs into Reddit using the provided credentials.
2. Posts a random image with a title to a subreddit.
3. Posts a random comment on the target post.

---

## Challenges Faced

- **Appium Setup Issues**: Initially attempted to use Appium for automation but faced issues with ChromeDriver compatibility. Switched to Selenium for better stability and broader support.
- **Dynamic Element Selection**: Encountered issues locating certain dynamic elements (e.g., comment boxes and post buttons). Resolved using Selenium's WebDriverWait and explicit conditions.
- **Time Constraints**: Due to the deadline, some features remain incomplete or require further optimization.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for additional Reddit functionalities like upvoting and replying to comments.
- Improve error handling for dynamic web elements.
- Enhance bot efficiency using AI-based automation tools.
